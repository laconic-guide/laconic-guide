        <h1>Laconic Skyrim SE Modding Guide</h1>

        <h2>A comprehensive overhaul of Skyrim SE</h2>

        <p>With over 500 mods, this guide touches almost every aspect of the game. Thousands of models and textures have been updated with the best the modding community has to offer, and the gameplay has been heavily modified as well to create a more challenging, rewarding, and realistic gameplay experience.</p>

        <p class="bottom-margin">This guide is the result of several months worth of work on my part to create the "perfect" Skyrim playthrough. Who knows if I've accomplished that, but I'm happy with the results either way. Now hopefully my obsession can benefit you in some way as you embark on (or continue) your modding journey.</p>

        <h2>This guide might <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> be for you if...</h2>

        <h3>...you prefer the vanilla look</h3>

        <p class="bottom-margin">This guide is not intended to give your game an "enhanced vanilla" look. If you follow it completely, it will make your game look <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 900;">VERY</span> different from vanilla. I think it looks better for the most part, but I admit there is a certain (blue-ish) charm to vanilla Skyrim that is somewhat lost due to the huge amount of texture and landscape changes  in my guide. If you prefer a more tradition Skyrim style, this guide might not be for you. You could try <a href="http://wiki.step-project.com/User:TechAngel85/SSE_Guide/v2" target="_blank">Tech's Skyrim SE Guide</a> instead, as it strives to keep more of the vanilla look intact. Feel free to check out the <a href="comparisons.html">comparisons</a> page if you want to see the difference between vanilla Skyrim SE and my guide.</p>

        <h3>...you're new to modding Skyrim</h3>

        <p>This guide isn't the most beginner friendly one out there. You'll have to make use of several different programs and patchers to get everything working properly, including SSEEdit, FNIS, Wrye Bash, Merge Plugins, Mator Smash, DynDOLOD, and more. If you don't know what a lot of those are or how to use them, you may want to go with a somewhat less complicated guide (<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15984">Skyrim SE It Just Works Edition</a> is one of my personal favorites). That being said, if you're up for the challenge then by all means go for it! I'm going to do my best to explain everything as I go in as much detail as possible without making things too wordy. I'm also happy to answer questions if you have them. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:laconic.guide@gmail.com?Subject="Laconic%20Guide" target="_top">laconic.guide@gmail.com</a>.</p>
