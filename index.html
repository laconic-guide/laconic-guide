        <h1>Laconic Skyrim SE Modding Guide</h1>
        <h2>A comprehensive overhaul of Skyrim SE</h2>
        <p>With over 500 mods, this guide touches almost every aspect of the game. Thousands of models and textures have been updated with the best the modding community has to offer, and the gameplay has been heavily modified as well to create a more challenging, rewarding, and realistic gameplay experience.</p>
        <p class="bottom-margin">This guide is the result of several months worth of work on my part to create the "perfect" Skyrim playthrough. Who knows if I've accomplished that, but I'm happy with the results either way. Now hopefully my obsession can benefit you in some way as you embark on (or continue) your modding journey.</p>
        <h2>This guide might <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> be for you if...</h2>
        <h3>...you prefer the vanilla Skyrim look</h3>
        <p>Fair warning: This guide is not intended to give your game an "enhanced vanilla" look. If you follow it completely, it will make your game look <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 900;">VERY</span> different from vanilla. I think it looks better for the most part, but I admit there is a certain (blue-ish) charm to vanilla Skyrim that is somewhat lost due to the huge amount of texture and landscape changes  in my guide. If you prefer a more vanilla-esque style, this guide might not be for you. You could try <a href="http://wiki.step-project.com/User:TechAngel85/SSE_Guide/v2" target="_blank">Tech's Skyrim Guide</a> instead, as it strives to keep more of the vanilla look intact. Feel free to check out the <a href="comparisons.html">comparisons</a> page if you want to see the differences between vanilla Skyrim SE and my guide.</p>
